# One Liners
Greetings hackers of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)! :computer: :tada:

## Challenge
I like oneliners, and I've like you to create a PR with your favorite onliner using Python. Or just a line of some sort - it's up to you :shrug: 

So far I've only created a list containing the alphabet (a-z). Let's see what we can accomplish to the end of Hacktober! 

### Contribute
See the rules below:

1. Your oneliner can be maximum 200 characters long.
2. Your onliner should extend the previous code written in `main.py`.
3. Your code should go below the prevous code of the `main.py` file.
4. Only **1** line of code for each PR.
5. **No** third-party packages.
6. After your submit, `main.py` should be able to run.

Happy coding :keyboard:
